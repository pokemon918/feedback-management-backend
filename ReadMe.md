# Home Assignment: Sentiment Analysis Application

## Description

This is a sentiment analysis application that allows users to analyze the sentiment of a given text.
Your (imagined) customer has developed a new product that they are selling on their e-commerce website.
The customer wants to get better insights into how their customers think about their product, so they are asking you to implement a Proof of Concept for a customer feedback form with sentiment analysis.

## Requirements

   - Implement a REST API, which takes text (up to 1000 characters) as input, calculates a sentiment of the text, and stores the results in a database.

   - Implement a REST API, which returns saved customer text messages together with calculated sentiments.

   - Implement a frontend application with a feedback form for the end customer and that displays existing feedback with sentiment to ADMIN users.

   - Tech stacks:
        - **Frontend:** React or Nextjs, tailwindcss or chakraUI
        - **Backend:** Nodejs, express, PostgreSQL

## Instructions

   - Design, implement, and test your solution.

   - Prepare a short, concise document (no presentation slides, 2 pages max) describing your solution (design, architecture, database structure if applicable).

   - Send us the document and your implementation in a ZIP file (please, exclude binaries and dependencies)

   - Your assignment is complete when you have a working solution that you can show to your customer.

## Advice/Hints

   - Since we already provide project backend infrastructure that contains user authentication and authorization, you should keep our codebase style and structure for this project.

   - Consider using existing libraries or cloud services for calculating sentiment.

   - Think of sentiment as simple classification (Good/Bad/Neutral).

   - Target for simplicity. Don't overcommit to the task, we value your personal time.

   - If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

   - If you manage to complete the task very fast, here are a couple of bonus tasks:

        - Integrate with blockchain as connecting with metamask using web3.js.

        - Deploy your solution to the cloud.

        - Implement engineering best practices (source control, CI/CD, infrastructure-as-a-code)
